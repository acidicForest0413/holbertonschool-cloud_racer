Cloud Racer! Created by Tammy, Victoria, and Nick

Our Inspiration?
Mario Kart. We are trying to create a simple racing game through Unity.

Design Process
We are using a basic template from unity for a racing game.
Each of us have contributed to the game. Tammy created the background and Nick created the Track. Victoria worked on debugging and getting everything to run. Victoria had previous experience in Unity and was able to help the rest of the group with the project. We all came up with ideas and sat down to figure out time frames and push to get everything done before the deadline. 

Challenges
Our biggest challenge for this project was merging conflicts. After that it was just time management. We all had ideas and we were trying to figure out what was actually possible in the time given. 

Overcoming our obstacles
Communication was key. We all came into this project with realistic expectations and were all wanting to give it our best.
